# AI Codebase Auditor

An AI senior developer for your repository.

Connect a GitHub repo or upload a ZIP. The app reads your JavaScript and TypeScript, builds a searchable knowledge of the code, then gives you a health report, a prioritized issue list, and chat answers grounded in real files.

</p>

<p align="center"><em>Health report with category scores and findings to review.</em></p>

## What you get

- **Health report** — architecture, security, performance, code quality, and testing, each scored 0–100
- **Issues & roadmap** — findings grouped by severity and category, ordered by what to fix first
- **Grounded chat** — ask how auth works, where payments live, or what a file does; answers cite files and line ranges
- **Code explorer** — browse the tree, read source, and ask the AI about the open file

</p>

Findings are **potential issues to review**, not certified security or performance results.

## How it works

```
Repository or ZIP
        ↓
  Filter & extract files
        ↓
  Detect framework
        ↓
  Parse JS / TS (Tree-sitter)
        ↓
  Chunk → embed → store in pgvector
        ↓
  Analyze with LLM → health report
        ↓
  Chat, explorer, and issues (RAG)
```

Only `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` are parsed. Noise such as `node_modules`, build output, binaries, and lockfiles is skipped. Embeddings run locally; chat and reports go through Groq.

## Getting started

You need **Node.js 20+**, **Yarn**, and a **Postgres** database with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension (Neon or Supabase work well).

```bash
yarn install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` (see below). Then enable pgvector, push the schema, and start the app:

```bash
# In your database (Supabase SQL editor, Neon console, or psql)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

yarn db:push
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For Stripe webhooks in development:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/billing/webhook
```

Copy the signing secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` and set at least the required keys:

| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                              | Postgres connection string (prefer the session pooler + `?sslmode=require`) |
| `AUTH_SECRET`                               | Auth.js secret (`openssl rand -base64 32`)                                  |
| `AUTH_URL`                                  | App URL (`http://localhost:3000` locally)                                   |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google sign-in                                                              |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub sign-in and repo access                                              |

| `STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM`                      | Recurring Premium price ID                                                  |

Embeddings use `@xenova/transformers` locally — no extra API key. Optional Groq model and plan-limit overrides are documented in `.env.example`.

OAuth callback URLs:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
```

GitHub sign-in also grants repository read access. Google or email users can connect GitHub later from Settings, or skip it and upload a ZIP.

## Limits (MVP)

- Max analyzed size: **100 MB** (after ignored files)
- Max files: **1,000**

- Languages: **JavaScript and TypeScript**

Free plan defaults: 5 analyses per day, 5 projects, 20 chat messages per hour. Premium raises those limits (configurable via env).
